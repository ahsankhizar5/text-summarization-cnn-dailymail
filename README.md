# Text Summarization with CNN/DailyMail Dataset

A comprehensive text summarization system that condenses lengthy news articles and blogs into concise summaries using both extractive and abstractive methods. Built with **spaCy**, **BERT**, and **GPT** via **HuggingFace Transformers**, the project explores the strengths of traditional and modern NLP techniques.

📄 Includes a detailed **Report.pdf** and explanatory **ProjectVideo.mp4** for academic presentation or documentation.
